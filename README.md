# week-3-JS-Password-Generator
Writing JS code for functionality on a password generating site. 

Variable arrays were written with the help of my instructor during office hours on 6/8/23

Other portions of the code were written with the help of Donnahue George via tutoring sessions on 6/19/23

This project was meant to test my skills in using JavaScript to get a password generator to function correctly using our basic JavaScript lessons in addition to extra help via office hours and tutoring.
